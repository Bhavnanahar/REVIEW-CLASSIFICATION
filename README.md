📊 Data
This project uses a dataset of product reviews. The data contains textual reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels, which are:

Review Text: The content of the review

Sentiment: The sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral)

You can use your own dataset or get the dataset from Dataset Link.

Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps are applied to the data:

Text cleaning (removal of special characters, stop words, etc.)

Tokenization and vectorization (e.g., using TF-IDF or Word2Vec)

🤖 Model
This project leverages supervised machine learning techniques for text classification. Models included in the project are:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Deep Learning Models (Optional)

You can experiment with various models to determine which one performs best.

🏋️‍♀️ Training
Train the Model
To train the model, use the following command:


⚡ Usage
Once the model is trained, use it to classify new reviews.
